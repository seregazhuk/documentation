In the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a Workflow is a class which implements a Workflow interface:

```java
public class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {
  // ...
}
```

## Workflow interface

The Workflow interface is a Java interface and is annotated with `@WorkflowInterface`.
Workflow interface methods must have one of the following annotations:

- **@WorkflowMethod** denotes the starting point of [Workflow Execution](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution). Workflow Execution completes when this method returns.
- **@SignalMethod** indicates that this method is a [Signal](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-signal) handler method and that it can react to external Signals.
  It can have parameters which can contain the Signal payload.
  It does not return a value, so it must have a `void` return type.
- **@QueryMethod** indicates that this method can be used to send a [Query](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-query) to the Workflow's state at any time during its execution.
  It can have parameters that can be used to filter a subset of the Workflow's state that it returns.
  Because it returns a value, it must have a return type that is not `void`.

A Workflow interface can define only a single method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`. However, it can define
any number of methods annotated with `@SignalMethod` or `@QueryMethod`, as in the following example:

```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface FileProcessingWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processFile(Arguments args);

    @QueryMethod(name="history")
    List<String> getHistory();

    @QueryMethod
    String getStatus();

    @SignalMethod
    void retryNow();

    @SignalMethod
    void abandon();
}
```

The `@WorkflowMethod` annotation has a `name` parameter, such as `@WorkflowMethod(name = "MyWorkflowType")`.
It can be used to denote the [Workflow Type](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type). If not set, the Workflow Type defaults to the short name of the Workflow interface. In the example above, the Workflow Type defaults to `FileProcessingWorkflow`.
A method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can have any number of parameters. We recommend passing a single parameter that contains all the input fields. This allows adding fields in a backward compatible manner.

The `@QueryMethod` annotation also has a `name` parameter, such as `@QueryMethod(name = "history")`.
It can be used to denote the Query name.
If not set, the Query name defaults to the name of the method.
In the preceding example, the Query name defaults to `getStatus`.

The `@SignalMethod` also has a `name` parameter, such as `@SignalMethod(name = "mysignal")`.
It can be used to denote the Signal type.
If not set, the Signal type defaults to the name of the method.
In the preceding example, the Signal type defaults to `retryNow` and `abandon`.

### Workflow interface inheritance

Workflow interfaces can form inheritance hierarchies, which can be useful for creating components that can be reused across multiple Workflow interfaces.
For example, to implement a UI or CLI button that sends a `retryNow` Signal to any Workflow, redesign the preceding interface example as follows:

```java
public interface Retryable {
    @SignalMethod
    void retryNow();
}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface FileProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processFile(Arguments args);

    @QueryMethod(name="history")
    List<String> getHistory();

    @QueryMethod
    String getStatus();

    @SignalMethod
    void abandon();
}
```

By using this approach, another Workflow interface can extend just `Retryable`:

```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface MediaProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processBlob(Arguments args);
}
```

Note that this approach does not apply to `@WorkflowMethod` annotations. This means that, when using a base interface, it should
not include any `@WorkflowMethod` methods.
To illustrate this, let's say that we define the following _invalid_ code:

```java
// INVALID CODE!
public interface BaseWorkflow {
    @WorkflowMethod
    void retryNow();
}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface Workflow1 extends BaseWorkflow {}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface Workflow2 extends BaseWorkflow {}
```

Attempting to register implementations of Workflow1 and Workflow2 with a Worker will fail.
Let's say that we have:

```java
worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(
        Workflow1Impl.class, Workflow2Impl.class);
```

This registration fails with the following message:

```text
java.lang.IllegalStateException: BaseWorkflow workflow type is already registered with the worker
```

## Workflow Implementation

A Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface.
Each time a new Workflow Execution is started, an instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.
Then, one of the methods (depending on the Workflow Type of the instance) annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can be invoked.
As soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is considered to be complete.

Workflow methods annotated with `@QueryMethod` and `@SignalMethod` can be invoked during a Workflow Execution.

Note that methods annotated with `@QueryMethod` can be invoked even when a Workflow is in the `Completed` state.

### Workflow implementation constraints

Temporal uses the [Event Sourcing pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) to recover the state of a Workflow object including its threads and local variable values.
In essence, every time a Workflow state is restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning.
Note that, during replay, successfully executed Activities are not re-executed because their results are already recorded
in the Event History of the Workflow Execution.

The following constraints apply when writing Workflow Definitions:

- Do not use mutable global variables in your Workflow implementations.
  This will assure that multiple Workflow instances are fully isolated.
- Do not call non-deterministic functions (such as non-seeded random or `UUID.randomUUID()`) directly from the Workflow code.
  The Temporal SDK provides specific API for calling non-deterministic code in your Workflows.
- Do not use programming language constructs that rely on system time.
  For example, only use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.
- Do not use native Java `Thread` or any other multi-threaded classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
  Use `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`, provided by the Temporal SDK, to execute code asynchronously.
- Do not use synchronization, locks, or other standard Java blocking concurrency-related classes besides those provided by the Workflow class.
  There is no need for explicit synchronization because multi-threaded code inside a Workflow is executed one thread at a time and under a global lock.
  - Call `Workflow.sleep` instead of `Thread.sleep`.
  - Use `Promise` and `CompletablePromise` instead of `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.
  - Use `WorkflowQueue` instead of `BlockingQueue`.
- Use `Workflow.getVersion` when making any changes to the Workflow code.
  Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code might break already running Workflows.
- Do not access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.
  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.

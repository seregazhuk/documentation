title: How to spawn a Child Workflow Execution in Java
sidebar_label: Child Workflow Execution
description: The first call to the Child Workflow stub can be synchronous or asynchronous using `Async.function(Functions.Func)` or `Async.procedure(Functions.Proc)`, and must always be to a method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`.
---

The first call to the Child Workflow stub must always be its Workflow method (method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).
Similar to Activities, invoking Child Workflow methods can be made synchronous or asynchronous by using `Async#function` or `Async#procedure`.
The synchronous call blocks until a Child Workflow method completes.
The asynchronous call returns a `Promise` which can be used to wait for the completion of the Child Workflow method, as in the following example:

```java
GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
Promise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);
// ...
greeting.get()
```

The following examples show how to spawn a Child Workflow:

- Spawn a Child Workflow from a Workflow:

  ```java
  // Child Workflow interface
  @WorkflowInterface
  public interface GreetingChild {
  @WorkflowMethod
  String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);
  }
  // Child Workflow implementation not shown

  // Parent Workflow implementation
  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

  @Override
  public String getGreeting(String name) {
      GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);

      // This is a blocking call that returns only after child has completed.
      return child.composeGreeting("Hello", name );
  }
  }
  ```

- Spawn two Child Workflows (with the same type) in parallel:

  ```java
  // Parent Workflow implementation
  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

      @Override
      public String getGreeting(String name) {

          // Workflows are stateful, so a new stub must be created for each new child.
          GreetingChild child1 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
          Promise<String> greeting1 = Async.function(child1::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);

          // Both children will run concurrently.
          GreetingChild child2 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
          Promise<String> greeting2 = Async.function(child2::composeGreeting, "Bye", name);

          // Do something else here.
          ...
          return "First: " + greeting1.get() + ", second: " + greeting2.get();
      }
  }
  ```

- Send a Signal to a Child Workflow from the parent:

  ```java
  // Child Workflow interface
  @WorkflowInterface
  public interface GreetingChild {
      @WorkflowMethod
      String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);

      @SignalMethod
      void updateName(String name);
  }

  // Parent Workflow implementation
  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

      @Override
      public String getGreeting(String name) {
          GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
          Promise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);
          child.updateName("Temporal");
          return greeting.get();
      }
  }
  ```

- Sending a Query to Child Workflows from within the parent Workflow code is not supported. However, you can send a Query to Child Workflows from Activities using `WorkflowClient`.

### ParentClosePolicy

When creating a Child Workflow, you can define a `ParentClosePolicy` that terminates, cancels, or abandons the Child Workflow Execution if the parent Workflow Execution stops.

- `ABANDON`: When the parent stops, don't do anything with the Child Workflow.
- `TERMINATE`: When the parent stops, terminate the Child Workflow
- `REQUEST_CANCEL`: When the parent stops, terminate the Child Workflow

You can set policies per Child Workflow, which means you can opt out of propagating terminations and cancellations on a per-child basis.
This is useful for starting Child Workflows asynchronously, as shown in the following example:

```java
   public void parentWorkflow() {
       ChildWorkflowOptions options =
          ChildWorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
              .setParentClosePolicy(ParentClosePolicy.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON)
              .build();
       MyChildWorkflow child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(MyChildWorkflow.class, options);
       Async.procedure(child::<workflowMethod>, <args>...);
       Promise<WorkflowExecution> childExecution = Workflow.getWorkflowExecution(child);
       // Wait for child to start
       childExecution.get()
  }
```

In this example, we are:

1. Setting `ChildWorkflowOptions.ParentClosePolicy` to `ABANDON` when creating a Child Workflow stub.
2. Starting Child Workflow Execution asynchronously using `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`.
3. Calling `Workflow.getWorkflowExecution(â€¦)` on the child stub.
4. Waiting for the `Promise` returned by `getWorkflowExecution` to complete.
   This indicates whether the Child Workflow started successfully (or failed).
5. Completing parent Workflow Execution asynchronously.

Steps 3 and 4 are needed to ensure that a Child Workflow Execution starts before the parent closes.
If the parent initiates a Child Workflow Execution and then immediately completes, the Child Workflow will never execute.
